Miku, Miku, you can call me Miku
Blue hair, blue tie, hiding in your Wi-Fi
Open secrets, anyone can find me
Hear your music running through my mind

I'm thinking Miku, Miku, hoo-hee-hoo
I'm thinking Miku, Miku, hoo-hee-hoo
I'm thinking Miku, Miku, hoo-hee-hoo
I'm thinking Miku, Miku, hoo-hee-hoo

I'm on top of the world because of you
All I wanted to do is follow you
I'll keep singing along to all of you
I'll keep singing along

I'm thinking Miku, Miku, hoo-hee-hoo
I'm thinking Miku, Miku, hoo-hee-hoo
I'm thinking Miku, Miku, hoo-hee-hoo
I'm thinking Miku, Miku, hoo-hee-hoo

Miku, Miku, what's it like to be you?
20/20, looking in the rear view
Play me, break me, make me feel like Superman
You can do anything you want

I'm on top of the world because of you
All I wanted to do is follow you
I'll keep singing along to all of you
I'll keep singing along

I'm thinking Miku, Miku, hoo-hee-hoo
I'm thinking Miku, Miku, hoo-hee-hoo
I'm thinking Miku, Miku, hoo-hee-hoo
I'm thinking Miku, Miku, hoo-hee-hoo
